![440x280.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerslickremix/slickGPT/main/screenshots/440x280.png)

## Description

A Chrome extension that adds [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to your browser. It can assist in creating content or code for any website based on your suggestions.

Choose between GPT-3 or GPT-4, the Number of Tokens, Alternative Completions, Temperature, Light and Dark Mode.

Below are some additional custom options to make the workflow a bit easier. Pin it to your browser so you can easily use it on any website. It will work independently between tabs too.

## Additional Custom Options

1. Select text on the web page and click the pinned extension, the selected text will automatically be pasted to the textarea in the chrome extension popup.
2. I added a STOP: after the pasted text so you can easily prompt your request, or not.
3. Once you click the "Get Suggestions" button one or more suggestions will appear.
4. You can then click on a suggestion and the text from that suggestion will be copied in place of the selected text on the webpage, if it's a content editable area.
5. The text will also be added to the clipboard allowing the you to paste it in another tab or anywhere.
6. Bonus: Click the Twitter icon that appears in the top right of a suggestion(s) and it will open Twitter so you can share the the suggestion.

You will need to add your own [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Setup is really simple, and if you don't already have an account with OpenAI, you will receive a free credit of $18 US dollars.

Cheaper than paying $20 a month for chatGPT Pro. More options, updated screenshots and video coming soon.
