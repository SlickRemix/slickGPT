# SlickRemix: ChatGPT Chrome Extension Web Assistant

![440x280.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencerslickremix/slickGPT/main/screenshots/440x280.png)

A Chrome extension that adds a customized version of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to your browser. It can assist in creating content or code for any website based on your suggestions.

Pin it to your browser so you can easily use it on any website. No need to switch between tabs.

Choose between GPT-3 or GPT-4, the Number of Tokens, Alternative Completions, Temperature, and Light and Dark Mode. An easy click to copy content and paste where ever you need it.

1. By selecting text on the web page and clicking the pinned extension, the selected text will be automatically pasted to the textarea in the chrome extension popup.
2. I added a STOP: after the text that is copied in the textarea so you can easily prompt your request, or not.
2. Once you click the "Get Suggestions" button one or more suggestions will appear.
3. You can then click on a suggestion and the text from that suggestion will be copied in place of the selected text on the webpage, if it's a content editable area.
4. The copied text will also be added to the clipboard allowing the user to paste it in another tab if they want, or anywhere that text can be pasted too.
5. As a bonus you can also click the Twitter icon that appears in the top right of a suggestion(s) and it will open Twitter so you can share the the suggestion.

You will need to add your own [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Setup is really simple, and if you don't already have an account with OpenAI, you will receive a free credit of $18 US dollars.

Cheaper than paying $20 a month for chatGPT Pro. More options, updated screenshots and video coming soon.
